## Overview
PC_Workman is a real-time system monitoring tool built in Python. It combines live performance diagnostics, AI-assisted analysis, and a modular architecture designed for intelligent system optimization.

**What it does:**
- Real-time CPU, GPU, RAM, and network monitoring
- Process intelligence (identifies what's consuming resources)
- AI-powered diagnostics via hck_GPT integration
- Historical trend analysis (see patterns over time)
- Gaming analytics with bottleneck detection

**Why it's different:**
- Traditional tools show "CPU: 87%" → PC_Workman explains *why*
- Time-travel diagnostics → click any historical point to see what was running
- Voltage spike detection → unique feature nobody else has
- Built for understanding, not just watching
-

Removed padding between navigation tabs for cleaner look
Killed animated gradients for better performance
Stripped unnecessary descriptive texts
### ! ✪ NEW: Floating System Monitor Widget ✪
Always-on-top overlay in top-right corner (outside main window!)
