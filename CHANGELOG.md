# HCK_Labs — PC_Workman_HCK — Changelog
_All notable changes are documented here._

## [1.7.8-monitoring] - 2026-06-05

### Bug fixes

**`ui/pages/startup_manager.py`**
- `_render()` crashes with `NameError: name 'self' is not defined` at line 930. Root cause: `host` parameter received by `build_startup_manager_page(host, parent)` was never forwarded into `_render()`. Page built the title label then died — everything below line 930 (tabs, panels, entries) was never rendered.
  - Fix: `_render()` now takes `host=None`; `_on_ready` passes `host=host`; `_full_refresh()` forwards it too.
  - `getattr(self, "_switch_to_page", None)` → `getattr(host, "_switch_to_page", None) if host else None`

**`ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py` — overlay header coverage**
- Main header "PC Workman v1.7.8 HCK Edition" remained visible for all overlay pages (MY PC, MONITORING, STATISTICS, etc.) because `_show_overlay()` placed the frame at `y=60` — deliberately below the 58px header.
  - Fix: non-settings overlays now use `y=0, relwidth=1.0, relheight=1.0` → full coverage. Settings stays at `y=60` (main header visible per spec).
  - Three prior fix attempts had treated this as a missing `pack_forget()` problem; the root cause was the hardcoded `y=60` offset in `place()`.

**`PCWorkman.spec`**
- Added `core.app_activity_tracker` and `core.hibernation_manager` to `hiddenimports` (both new modules were missing from the build manifest).

### New: `core/thermal_baseline.py`

Workload-aware CPU temperature baseline learning.

- Five workload buckets: `idle` (CPU<15%) / `light` / `medium` / `heavy` / `gaming` (GPU≥60%)
- Per-bucket statistics: Welford's online algorithm applied to DeepMonitor snapshots from last 14 days. Produces `mean`, `σ`, `p5`, `p95` per bucket. Fresh stats computed from DB on each `rebuild()`, not incremental EMA — avoids the "learned spike" problem.
- Training levels: `no_data` → `initializing` → `learning` → `basic` → `trained` → `calibrated` (thresholds: 5/20/60/200 samples).
- JSON persistence: `data/cache/thermal_baseline.json`. Fast startup, version-checked.
- `BaselineRange.context_label(temp)` returns `"14% above usual  (Gaming: 65–78°C, ±2.3°C)"` — used as chart tooltip and hck_GPT context.
- `thermal_baseline.maybe_rebuild(min_interval_s=300)` — self-throttled async rebuild, called on each monitoring page refresh.
- Singleton: `thermal_baseline`.

---

### New: `core/voltage_analyzer.py`

SPC-based voltage rail intelligence using Median + MAD (not mean + σ).

**Why MAD:** A spike shifts the mean toward itself, widening the "normal band" and hiding subsequent spikes. Median is unaffected by outliers. MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) inherits this property.

**Algorithm:** Modified z-score (Iglewicz & Hoaglin 1993): `M = 0.6745 × (x − median) / MAD`. Anomaly if `|M| > 3.5`, warning if `|M| > 2.5`.

**Nelson SPC rules implemented:**
- Rule 1: single point beyond `Z_ANOMALY` → `isolated_spike`
- Rule 5: 2-of-3 consecutive points beyond `Z_WARNING` (same sign) → `cluster`
- Rule 2: 9 consecutive points same side of median → `sustained_high` / `sustained_low`
- Rule 3: 6 consecutive monotonically changing points → `trend_up` / `trend_down`

**Context suppression:** 12V rail spikes during GPU load delta >25% → downgraded to `transient` (physically expected behavior).

**Anomaly decay:** Same spike magnitude (±30% tolerance) appearing ≥5 times → severity reduced one tier and flagged as "learned normal".

**hck_GPT API:**
- `format_for_chat(lang)` — formatted multi-line voltage status string, chat-ready.
- `get_anomaly_summary()` — structured dict per rail (n_crit, n_warn, health, latest reason).
- `VoltageEvent.reason_for_chat(lang)` — bilingual event description.

Persistence: `data/cache/voltage_baseline.json`. Requires LHM/OHM for real data; graceful no-data path.

---

### New: `ui/components/interactive_chart.py`

Reusable Tkinter canvas chart with full interaction model.

- **Pan:** left-drag → shift view window (data-index space)
- **Zoom:** scroll wheel → expand/contract around cursor X (factor 0.75×/1.33×)
- **Reset:** double-click or "⟲ reset" button
- **Crosshair:** dotted X+Y lines follow cursor with live value bubble
- **Pin:** single click → anchor detailed tooltip on nearest data point. Shows: timestamp, all series values, deviation from baseline (`▲ 14% vs learned baseline`), anomaly `[event_type]` + reason. Persists until click-elsewhere or double-click.
- **Minimap:** 18px strip below chart. Full data range compressed view. Darkened overlay outside selection window. Click or drag to jump/pan.
- **Baseline band:** shaded region from `set_baseline(mean, lo, hi)` (e.g. from `thermal_baseline`).
- **Anomaly markers:** colored vertical lines + dots at anomaly indices.
- **Multi-series:** `set_series([{values, color, label}, ...])` — stacked filled areas + lines.

---

### Modified: `ui/pages/monitoring_alerts.py`

- **InteractiveChart integration:** Temperature and Load sections now use `InteractiveChart` instead of static canvas when available. Fallback to existing draw functions if import fails.
- **Learning Status Bar:** compact row above Temperature section — 5 colored bucket pills (idle/light/medium/heavy/gaming) with training level color coding and sample count. Overall `%` badge + "rebuilt X min ago".
- **Workload-context temperature:** `_refresh_temp()` classifies workload from recent data, fetches `thermal_baseline.get_range(bucket)`, passes `ext_mean/lo/hi` to `_draw_adaptive_chart()`. Badge shows `"Normal (Gaming: 65–78°C)"` instead of generic `"No regular problems"`.
- **Temperature stats:** `temp_lifetime_avg` label now shows `45.2°C ±3.1` (learned baseline mean±σ) instead of `--`.
- **Voltage Rails section** (`_build_voltage_section`): Three-column SPC display (12V / 5V / 3.3V). Each column: `InteractiveChart`-compatible canvas, stats (Median / MAD / UCL / LCL / Samples), health badge. No-data path shows LHM explanation. Badge driven by `_refresh_voltage()` using `voltage_analyzer`.
- **Voltage chart** (`_draw_voltage_chart`): Tight Y-axis (nominal ±10%). Layers: ATX spec band / normal band / warn dashed lines / UCL+LCL dashed / nominal dotted / actual line / anomaly dots.
- **Auto-baseline rebuild:** `_start_refresh()` now calls `thermal_baseline.maybe_rebuild(300)` and `voltage_analyzer.maybe_rebuild(300)` on every 30s refresh cycle.

---

### Modified: `hck_gpt/memory/proactive_monitor.py`

- Two new alert message pools: `voltage_spike` and `voltage_trend` (PL + EN).
- `_volt_check_tick` counter — voltage check runs every 4 main cycles (~3 min; lighter than main checks).
- `_was_volt_anomaly` state — prevents alert spam; fires once per anomaly window, clears on resolution.
- `_check_voltage_rails()`: loads last 60 min from `voltage_analyzer.analyze_history()`, filters suppressed/decayed/info events, fires `voltage_spike` or `voltage_trend` alert through existing `_alert()` system (session budget + gap protection apply).

---

### Modified: `ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py` — dashboard chart

- `realtime_canvas` now has `<ButtonPress-1>`, `<Motion>`, `<Leave>` bindings.
- `_chart_on_click()`: pins/unpins a detail tooltip on the nearest bar (second click on same bar = unpin).
- `_chart_on_motion()`: hover tooltip when nothing is pinned (bar index → CPU/RAM/GPU% + "Xs ago").
- Tooltip is a `tk.Label` placed on `self.root` via `.place()` — appears above cursor, clamped to window bounds. Shows `[pinned]` tag when click-anchored.

## [1.7.7-patched] - 2026-06-03

UI/UX audit pass — 5 targeted fixes found during post-release review.
No new features. No breaking changes. Safe upgrade from v1.7.7.

### Startup Manager — UX overhaul

**`ui/pages/startup_manager.py`**

- Renamed "Needs Attention" section header to **"Startup Menu"** — matches the tab label, clearer purpose
- Removed non-functional "All entries" panel from the split layout — page now shows a single full-width list of flagged entries
- Fixed geometry manager conflict (`pack` + `grid` on same parent) — admin notice moved inside `header_block`; notice now survives `_full_refresh()` calls
- Auto-refresh after restoring a disabled entry works correctly — `_full_refresh()` re-reads registry and rebuilds view immediately

### Services Manager — stop/start logic fix

**`ui/pages/services_manager.py`**

- **Both Stop and Start buttons now always visible** for every non-essential, non-disabled service
  - Active direction: full color (Stop = red, Start = green)
  - Inactive direction: muted/ghosted — makes it immediately clear both operations are available
  - Previously: only the "relevant" button was shown, which made the page look like it could only enable services
- Expand banner text changed from `∨ Show N more ∨` to **`∨ Rozwiń więcej (N) ∨`** (Polish, compact `pady=2`)

### First Setup & Drivers — readability + GHOST visibility

**`ui/pages/first_setup_drivers.py`**

- **GHOST badge now visible immediately on card header** — `card["badge"]` overridden with bordeaux `⚠ N ghost` text when ghost detected; no longer requires expanding the card
- Ghost devices in expanded panel highlighted with bordeaux background + `⚠ GHOST` badge (was plain row)
- Expand button now shows count: `▼ pokaż wszystkie (N)` / `▲ zwiń`; shows `⚠ GHOST` suffix when ghosts present
- Subcategory text ("Display / Graphics", "Sound Device" etc.): color `#5a6a80` → `#8a9db8` — clearly readable
- Expand button font: 6pt → 7pt, color `#4b5563` → `#6b7280`
- Ghost badge font: 5pt → 7pt + increased padding
- `ghost_names` set now passed from `_apply` to `_fill_expand_panel` — expand panel knows which devices are ghosts

### Page headers — compact back button

**`ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py`**

- `_build_page_header()`: height 60px → 26px; removed large title and subtitle labels (already shown inside page); kept only `← Główne Menu` in small muted style
- Applies to: Startup Manager, Services Manager, and all other sub-pages using `_build_page_header`

---

## [1.7.7] - 2026-06-02

### Ghost Driver Detection — new feature

**`ui/pages/first_setup_drivers.py`**

- Ghost drivers = driver packages left in Windows registry after replacing hardware (e.g. old GPU still installed after swap)
- Detection: `pnputil /enum-devices /class {guid} /connected` returns only physically present hardware; anything in the registry but not in connected output is flagged as ghost
- WMI (`Win32_VideoController`) was intentionally avoided — it returns phantom devices too, making it unreliable for this use case
- Ghost entries shown with bordeaux background, `⚠` marker, and `100% UNUSED` / `⚠ GHOST` badge visible on card header without expanding
- `_open_ghost_dialog()` — Toplevel popup with device age, version, explanation, and optional removal
- `pnputil /remove-device <instanceID> /subtree` for removal (admin required, confirmation dialog)
- Works across all 4 driver categories: GPU, Audio, Network, USB

### Drivers tab — SEE EVERYTHING / SEE OUTDATED views

- Two mode buttons added to DRIVER HEALTH section header
- **SEE EVERYTHING** — all detected drivers across all classes, grouped by category (GPU first), ghost entries highlighted
- **SEE OUTDATED (N)** — only drivers >= 730 days (~24 months), sorted oldest first; count badge updated after scan
- BACK button replaces mode buttons while in extended view
- `_build_see_everything_view()`, `_build_see_outdated_view()` — self-contained view builders
- Extended views show: category badge, device name, version, date, age badge, ghost marker where applicable

### Drivers tab — all devices per class

- `_read_all_class_drivers(guid)` — collects all unique devices per class (not just first entry)
- Each driver card: expand button `▼ show all (N)` reveals complete device list
- Per-device: name, version, date badge, age color (730+ days = red, 365-730 = amber)
- Devices >= 730 days marked red in expand panel

### Optimization — Auto RAM Flush process exclusion

**`ui/pages/optimization_services.py`**

- `_RAM_EXCLUDE: set` — module-level exclusion list, loaded from `user_prefs.json → optimization.ram_flush_exclude` at startup
- `_do_ram_flush()` — skips excluded processes by name; result shows `N protected` count
- `_build_exclusion_panel()` — bordeaux-styled panel inside RAM Flush card expand area:
  - Process list: excluded first (always visible even offline), then running alphabetically
  - Click to toggle protection; `↺ Refresh` reloads live process list
  - Excluded processes persist across app restarts
- `_save_exclude()` — writes sorted list to prefs immediately on toggle

### hck_GPT panel — HOT strip duplicate monitor removed

**`hck_gpt/panel.py`**

- Removed `_hot_monitor_tick()` and `_start_hot_monitor()` — they duplicated proactive_monitor's HOT logic at lower thresholds (RAM >= 85% vs proactive_monitor's 93%), causing double-triggers
- HOT strip now driven exclusively by `proactive_monitor` via `register_hot()` callback
- Also removed broken Polish strings from the panel-side monitor (missing diacritics: "duz uzuzycie", "Uwazaj", "goraca")

### hck_GPT — intent alias fix

**`hck_gpt/responses/builder.py`**

- `ram_flush` alias: `ram_why_high` → `optimization` — user asking to flush RAM gets actionable optimization response instead of a diagnosis

### MAP OF COMPONENTS — case_front fix

**`ui/components/pc_map.py`**

- Removed solid `case_front` panel (7.5×15 box drawn last, covering all internals in screen-space)
- Replaced with 4 thin structural corner rails — open-front case look, all components visible

### Admin notices

**`ui/pages/startup_manager.py`**

- Non-admin notice upgraded: amber warning matching Services Manager style — `⚠ Not running as Administrator — HKLM startup entries cannot be modified. Right-click PC Workman → Run as administrator.`

---

## [1.7.6] - 2026-05-29

### DeepMonitor — complete rewrite

**`ui/components/pro_info_table.py`** rewritten as `DeepMonitorTable` (alias `ProInfoTable` kept):
- `ttk.Treeview` with 4 aligned columns (Sensor / Value / Min / Max) — no more misaligned labels
- Temperature rows: blue-night background tint; Utilization rows: indigo tint; per-row color intensifies with heat
- Sub-section headers color-coded by type (CPU temp = steel-blue, GPU = violet, Memory = slate-blue, Clocks = teal)
- Action bar: Save Data (filedialog → .txt / .csv), Pause (amber when active), Reset mins/maxes
- Popup: header bar removed, title `"DeepMonitor - PC Workman"`, size 660×760

### MAP OF COMPONENTS — new feature

New file **`ui/components/pc_map.py`**:
- `PCMapView(tk.Frame)` renders a 2.5D isometric PC scene via Pillow at 2× SSAA (1360×1080 → LANCZOS → 680×540)
- Desktop PC mode: case frame, motherboard PCB, CPU + heatsink fins + heatpipes, GPU with fans, RAM sticks (×2/4), SSD, PSU, case fans, cable bundle, LED strip
- Laptop mode: open chassis with horizontal mobo, dual fans, GPU, RAM, M.2 SSD, battery, hinged screen, keyboard grid, trackpad
- Live data: CPU%/temp, GPU temp, RAM%, disk% sourced from psutil + `get_cpu_temp/get_gpu_temp`
- Component colors shift green → amber → red based on heat; hot components pulse via sine-wave animation
- Glow ring under CPU when temp >75°C (GaussianBlur alpha composite)
- Floating labels with connecting lines; live values (e.g. "CPU 34% 52°C")
- Hover bounding-box detection → Toplevel tooltip with component details
- Status bar: CPU%/temp GPU/temp RAM% Disk%
- Wired into My PC as new "MAP" tab (PL: "MAPA", with " PC" superscript badge)
- Data refresh thread every 3s (background, non-blocking)

### hck_GPT — critical bug fix

- **`panel.py`**: `lang` variable undefined in `_welcome()` caused `NameError` on every startup — propagated to `_build_hckgpt_banner()` except block, which showed the `bg="#8b5cf6"` (violet) fallback bar at the bottom of the window. Fixed: `lang = self._ui_lang` added at top of `_welcome()`.

### hck_GPT — Wave 2 community intents (6 new)

Built from community feedback (GitHub Discussions / LinkedIn). All intents have PL+EN patterns, real hardware data, and no hallucination fallback.

- `game_can_run` — checks 20-game `_GAME_DB` for RAM/VRAM/disk requirements vs installed hardware
- `gaming_ram_usage` — live game process RAM (psutil) + session peak + 7-day comparison
- `daily_ram_usage` — live psutil + 7-day `metrics_store` trend; verdict: very high / high / moderate / low
- `battery_estimate` — `psutil.sensors_battery()` + activity-based drain rate (gaming 22-35%/h, work 8-15%/h, idle 3-6%/h)
- `upgrade_feasibility` — WMI slot count + current sticks + disk partitions; reports free slots, max RAM, disk free space
- `top_resource_hog` — TOP 5 by RSS memory + TOP 5 by cumulative disk I/O; auto-detects if user asked for RAM or disk

**Vocabulary:** 76 -> **82 intents** total (68 rule handlers in builder.py)

### hck_GPT — conversation flow

New routing steps in `chat_handler.py` (before the AI parser):
- Step 3.5: greeting detection — "cześć", "hej", "hi", "hello" → warm live-data response with CPU%/RAM%
- Step 3.6: thanks detection — "dzięki", "thanks", "thx" → friendly acknowledgment (4 PL + 4 EN variants)
- Step 3.7: "more info" — "więcej", "tell me more", "rozwiń" → re-runs last intent with refreshed data
- Step 3.8: "what should I do" — "co zrobić", "jak naprawić" → context-aware routing based on last topic + recent events
- `_default_response` now: retries hybrid engine at confidence 0.18, detects `.exe` names → routes to `process_identity`, varies fallback text (4 PL + 4 EN phrases), shows last conversation topic
- Fixed duplicate `"bateria"`/`"battery"` keys in `_QUICK_ALIASES` (both silently resolved to `battery_estimate` only; `battery_drain_rate` was unreachable)

New `builder.py` handlers: `_resp_greeting`, `_resp_thanks`, `_resp_health_check` (rewritten — score 0-100, live CPU/GPU temps, issues list, delta vs typical, verdict badge)

Small talk pool: 5 → 11 variants PL, 5 → 11 EN.

### hck_GPT — proactive monitor — DeepMonitor integration

**`proactive_monitor.py`** new `_check_deepmonitor()` (runs every 3 main cycles ≈ 2 min 15s):
- CPU temp: warn >80°C, critical >90°C (2 consecutive readings, hysteresis)
- GPU temp: warn >82°C, critical >92°C
- Severe throttle: alert when CPU freq <55% of max (separate from normal throttle)
- Multi-drive disk: scans ALL mounted drives (not just C:), alerts any <8 GB free
- Sensor health insight: positive "all clear" message after an issue resolves
- 8 new message pools (PL + EN) for the above events

Banner status text now includes live temperatures: `CPU 34%  RAM 62%  CPU 52°C  GPU 68°C  - OK`

Polish idle tips pool: 11 → 24 entries.

### hck_GPT — system context temperature fix

**`hck_gpt/context/system_context.py`** `snapshot()` now fetches `cpu_temp` and `gpu_temp` via `core.hardware_sensors.get_cpu_temp/get_gpu_temp` (LibreHardwareMonitor-backed). Previously only used `psutil.sensors_temperatures()` which returns nothing on Windows — meaning all temperature-based proactive alerts and LLM context were silently broken.

`build_prompt_context()` now includes `cpu_temp` inline with CPU line and a `GPU temp: XX°C` line.

Ollama system prompt: added `[Recent Conversation]` section (last 3 exchanges), 3 new rules (context continuity, frustration acknowledgment, personality).

### hck_GPT — Language sync

- `panel.py`: `_ui_lang` now initialized from `i18n.get_lang()` instead of hardcoded `"en"`
- `panel.py`: `_on_i18n_lang_changed()` callback registered via `i18n.register_on_change()` — when Settings page switches language, hck_GPT panel updates language and refreshes welcome screen
- `panel.py`: `_welcome()` and `_add_startup_quip()` now bilingual (PL/EN)
- `panel.py`: Polish language option `"⚠ not stable"` badge removed
- `panel.py`: language popup `_select()` calls `i18n.set_lang()` to propagate change globally

### Process library

- **`data/process_library.json`**: 241 → **373 entries** (+82 common processes, +50 games)
- New processes: Signal, Viber, Webex, Bitwarden, KeePassXC, VeraCrypt, Mullvad/ProtonVPN, MPV, PotPlayer, Kodi, foobar2000, AutoHotkey, ShareX, PowerToys, WizTree, Krita, Godot 3/4, Unreal Editor, Obsidian, REAPER, FL Studio, HeidiSQL, RustDesk, Parsec, latencymon, kubectl, kubectl, qBittorrent, Duplicati, WinGet, Rufus, Chocolatey, and more
- New games: RDR2, Horizon ZD/FW, Helldivers 2, Palworld, Satisfactory, Rust, DayZ, Sons of the Forest, Factorio, Cities 1/2, CK3, EU4, HoI4, Stellaris, Victoria 3, TW Warhammer 3, MHW/MHR, RE4/RE8, DMC5, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, DBD, Hunt Showdown, Phasmophobia, Alan Wake 2, and more

- **`core/process_definitions.py`**: +25 rich entries with `full_name`, `category`, `description`, `purpose`, `normal_behavior`, `warning`, `developer` fields: Brave, Vivaldi, Slack, Zoom, Telegram, WhatsApp, Skype, Signal, Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, Bitwarden, Python, Node.js, Git, Godot 3/4, Unreal Editor, VLC, OBS, GIMP, Krita, Blender, Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, and others

### import_core.py — startup registry

- Every registered component now gets a sequential `seq` number (auto-incrementing, thread-safe)
- `list_components()` now shows `[01] core.logger  [ok]` — sorted by registration order
- `STARTUP_MANIFEST` — list of 20 expected components with intended startup order
- `verify_startup()` — checks registered components vs manifest; returns `{ok, missing, extra, report}` with tick/cross table
- 5 previously unregistered components now register themselves: `hck_gpt.proactive_monitor`, `hck_stats_engine.db_manager`, `hck_stats_engine.aggregator`, `hck_stats_engine.query_api`, `core.startup_watcher`

### Dashboard UI fixes

- **Turbo Boost** frame height: `fill="both", expand=True` on inner frame caused it to stretch vertically — changed to `fill="x"`
- **Optimization Center** excess space: two empty placeholder labels (`tools_label`, `tools_count_label`) removed; `expand=True` removed from content frames
- Both fixes applied to `_build_feature_buttons()` in `main_window_expanded.py`

### Welcome Toast

**`ui/components/system_toast.py`** — new `show_welcome_toast(root, delay_ms=1800)`:
- Slides in from bottom-right 1.8 s after UI is ready
- Auto-detects Windows system language via `GetUserDefaultUILanguage` LCID + `locale` fallback
- Polish: *"Hej! Dziękujemy, że korzystasz z PC Workmana :)"* / English: *"Hey! Thanks for using PC Workman :)"*
- Body text explains the startup monitoring and proactive alerts in user's language
- Version badge: `v1.7.6 · 29.05.2026`
- Violet/indigo colour scheme with hand-drawn PC/WK canvas badge icon
- Wired into `startup.py` right after UI creation

### MAP OF COMPONENTS — display fix

**`ui/components/pc_map.py`**:
- Added vertical scrollbar to canvas wrapper — scene no longer clips at bottom of smaller tabs
- Mouse-wheel scroll support on canvas
- Desktop PC origin `_OY` raised by 40 px (`_CH - 75` -> `_CH - 115`): most of scene visible without scrolling
- Laptop origin `_LOY` raised by 40 px (`_CH - 90` -> `_CH - 130`) to match

### hck_GPT — HOT alert strip (anti-spam system alerts)

**`hck_gpt/panel.py`** — new dark-red `HOT` strip above the `TIP` strip:
- Crimson badge `HOT` + message text; visually connects to TIP section
- Monitors RAM / CPU / GPU temp every 8 s via `_hot_monitor_tick()`
- **Anti-spam logic**: strip appears once when threshold is crossed, stays silently until metrics return to normal — no repeated pop-ins while condition holds
- Thresholds: RAM ≥ 85 % warn / ≥ 92 % critical; CPU ≥ 88 % warn / ≥ 95 % critical; GPU temp ≥ 90 °C critical
- Messages bilingual PL/EN matching `_ui_lang`
- First check 12 s after startup (app settle time); cleared via `_clear_hot()` when all metrics normal
- Widget packed `before=_tip_strip` (or before input if no tip) — always below HOT, above entry

### Font system — 100% UI coverage

**`utils/fonts.py`** already defined `UI` and `MONO` (Inter/Segoe UI + Consolas). Previously ~50% of the UI used it.

All remaining files now import the font system and use `_HDR` / `_BODY` / `_MONO` aliases:

- **`ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py`** — 140 hardcoded font strings replaced (largest file)
- **`ui/windows/main_window.py`** — 45 strings replaced
- **`ui/pages/monitoring_alerts.py`** — 52 strings replaced
- **`ui/pages/first_setup_drivers.py`** — 38 strings replaced
- **`ui/pages/optimization_services.py`** — `_F`/`_M` aliases upgraded to full system + `_HDR` added

- **`ui/components/led_bars.py`** — font system added
- **`ui/components/charts.py`** — font system added
- **`ui/components/process_tooltip.py`** — font system added
- **`ui/guide/live_guide.py`** — remaining strings replaced
- **`ui/overlay_widget.py`** — font system added
- **`ui/overlay_mini_monitor.py`** — `_F_*` font constants migrated to `_BODY`/`_HDR` variables
- **`ui/dialogs.py`** — font system added
- **`ui/splash_screen.py`** — font system added
- **`ui/theme.py`** — `font_family`/`font_small`/`font_base`/`font_large` now use `_UIF`/`_MONOF` variables

Result: zero hardcoded `"Segoe UI"` / `"Consolas"` strings in the UI layer (intentional weight variants `Segoe UI Light`, `Segoe UI Black`, `Segoe UI Semilight` preserved where used as design choices).

### Code quality

- Replaced all em-dashes `—` with `-` and arrows `->` / `<-` across 58 Python files (1,135 em-dashes, 367 right arrows, 44 left arrows)
- Archived `PC_Workman HCK.exe` (v1.7.5) to `build/archive_v175/`

## [1.7.5] - 2026-05-25

### hck_GPT — 13 new intents (community requests)

Built from 28 real responses collected on GitHub Discussions and LinkedIn.

**New intents added to `vocabulary.py` / `hybrid_engine.py` / `builder.py`:**
- `fan_noise_history` — fan speed trend over time, spike detection
- `driver_status` — installed driver ages from Windows registry
- `gaming_vs_work_time` — session split: gaming vs productivity
- `process_identity` — identify unknown process (lookup + safety rating)
- `stale_apps` — apps open but idle for 30+ min
- `fps_degradation` — FPS drop over session with thermal/CPU correlation
- `app_behavior_change` — detect if an app behaves differently than usual
- `startup_slowdown` — boot time trend across sessions
- `temp_comparison` — today's temps vs N-day average
- `crash_context` — what was running at the last crash
- `game_hardware_stress` — hardware load profile during gaming sessions
- `battery_drain_rate` — battery % loss rate, drain source identification
- `power_after_restart` — power draw comparison before/after restart

**Vocabulary:** 63 → **76 intents** total

### hck_GPT — 4 MEGA features

**Context Time-Windowing** (`hybrid_engine.py`)
- `_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` dict — 21 intents mapped to history windows (5 min → 7 days)
- `build_llm_context_windowed()` in `system_context.py` — context scoped to the intent's window; narrow windows strip stale patterns, wide windows append daily metric history

**Fallback / No-AI-Slop** (`builder.py`)
- `_no_data(intent, lang, what_missing)` — structured "data unavailable" response instead of hallucinating; wired into `stale_apps`, `startup_slowdown`, `gaming_vs_work_time`, `temp_comparison`

**Time-Travel Debugging** (`builder.py`)
- `_get_historical_comparison(metric, days, lang)` — compares live sensor value to N-day historical average from `metrics_store.daily_summary()`
- `_METRIC_COL_MAP` — maps user-facing metric names to correct SQL column aliases

**Micro-Benchmarking** (`builder.py`)
- `_trigger_micro_benchmark(bench_type)` — background thread; `cpu_single` (1M sqrt ops) or `disk_seq` (32 MB write+read); results stored in `session_memory` under `micro_bench`

### hck_GPT — session memory additions (`session_memory.py`)
- `get_events_for_window(within_minutes)` — filtered event list for time-windowed context
- `get_spike_context(within_minutes)` — structured spike summary string
- `get_time_windowed_context(intent, lang)` — intent-aware windowed context builder

### hck_GPT — chat handler (`chat_handler.py`)
- 20 new quick aliases (sterowniki, wentylatory, bateria, crash, degradacja fps, etc.)
- `_show_help()` rebuilt with 3 new sections: Time-Travel Diagnostyka, Identyfikacja i bezpieczeństwo, Nawyki i użytkowanie

### Process Library (`data/process_library.json`)
- **104 → 241 entries** (+137 processes)
- New coverage: games (CS2, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk, Tarkov, BG3, KSP, Valheim…), dev tools (PyCharm, IntelliJ, Rider, Cursor, DBeaver…), RGB/peripherals (iCUE, Synapse, Armoury Crate, OpenRGB…), diagnostics (HWiNFO64, GPU-Z, Prime95, FurMark…), VPN/network (WireGuard, Tailscale, NordVPN…), security (BattlEye, EAC, FACEIT, ESET, Bitdefender…), Windows system processes (ntoskrnl, tiworker, audiodg, wsappx, ctfmon…)

### Fixes
- `fan_dashboard.py` — fan settings export now writes to `settings/` instead of project root
- Added `.gitignore` with proper rules for build folders, user exports, and runtime reports

---

## [1.7.4] - 2026-05-14

### Optimization Center — Full Redesign

**`ui/pages/optimization_services.py`**
- Feature grid rebuilt as 2-column layout with equal-width expandable cards; each card has an inline [i] info panel that opens/collapses without leaving the page
- Snapshot strip (CPU / RAM / Disk) now renders subtle fill bars — 9% blend of accent color into surface background, drawn on Canvas to work around Tkinter's lack of alpha channel support
- **Turbo Power Plan**: actually creates a "Turbo PC" power scheme via `powercfg /duplicatescheme` instead of just activating a preset; admin detection via `ctypes.IsUserAnAdmin`; GUID parser rewritten to be language-agnostic (no longer breaks on Polish or other non-English Windows); fallback to Ultimate Performance GUID if HP plan unavailable; `atexit` handler restores original plan on exit
- **Quick Actions** fully replaced: Startup Apps Manager (nav link), Services Manager (nav link), Disk Defragmenter (run), Weekly Performance Report (opens window); removed old shortcuts (flush / telemetry / gaming mode); removed "ALL 4 run on TURBO BOOST" label; accent bars widened to 4px; RUN/OPEN buttons larger; Weekly Report row has dark-green background to distinguish it
- **Weekly Performance Report**: `Toplevel` window with 6 bar charts (3×2 grid) — CPU avg, CPU peak, GPU avg, GPU peak, RAM avg, RAM peak across 4 rolling weeks; W4 = latest week rendered full-color + bold; older bars blended toward background; glow/shadow on latest bar; AI-generated text summary (trend direction, RAM pressure, spike detection); EXPORT .TXT button
- **LIVE NOW** sidebar panel: auto-refreshing CPU/RAM/GPU mini-bars, updates every 2 s via `after()`
- Typography upgraded: feature card titles `("Segoe UI Semibold", 8)`, descriptions larger and readable, Quick Actions labels in Segoe UI Semibold; fixed icon Canvas widgets being created before parent frame existed (reparenting via `configure(master=...)` is invalid in Tkinter — fixed by passing parent at creation)

**`ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py`**
- "More Optimization Tools" button replaced with a subtle dark "Optimization Center" chip (`#0c1018` bg, `#1a2235` border, muted text `#3d5070`); click navigates to My PC → Hardware & Health; glow animation removed

**`ui/components/yourpc_page.py`**
- Added `utils.fonts` import with `_HDR / _BODY / _MONO` aliases so the page uses the same Inter/Segoe UI Semibold font system as the rest of the app

---

## [1.7.3] - 2026-05-02

### Live Guide — nowy moduł

**`ui/guide/live_guide.py`** — nowy plik
- Klasa `LiveGuide`: interaktywna nakładka spotlight na dashboard
- Windows-only technika: `Toplevel` z `wm_attributes("-transparentcolor", "#ffffff")` + `-alpha 0.82`; białe prostokąty canvas = przeźroczyste "dziury", ciemny `#030610` przyciemnia resztę ekranu
- 3 kroki: (1) realtime chart + przyciski filtrów LIVE/1H/4H/1D/1W/1M → (2) lewa/prawa nawigacja z opisem każdego przycisku → (3) karty hardware CPU/RAM/GPU + słupki Session Averages
- Pływająca karta info: pasek akcentu `#8b5cf6`, badge kroku, tytuł, separator, treść, kropki postępu, przycisk DALEJ/Zakończ, ✕ zamknięcie; ESC zamyka overlay
- `_get_spotlight(key)` oblicza bounds celu via `winfo_rootx/y/width/height` relative do `content_area`
- Pozycjonowanie karty: bottom/top/right/center z flip-fallback gdy za blisko krawędzi
- Package marker: `ui/guide/__init__.py`

**`ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py`**
- Dodano `self.guide_left_nav`, `self.guide_middle_center`, `self.guide_right_nav` jako widget refs w `_build_middle_section()`
- `_live_guide_click`: `_close_overlay()` + 280ms delay → `_start_live_guide()`
- `_start_live_guide()`: guard na `current_view == "dashboard"`, guard na `realtime_canvas`, zamknięcie poprzedniej instancji; tworzy i uruchamia `LiveGuide(self)`
- Import blok z graceful fallback gdy `ui.guide.live_guide` niedostępny

### hck_GPT — jakość odpowiedzi

**`hck_gpt/responses/builder.py`**

- `_FOLLOWUPS` rozszerzony 3 → 8 kluczy: dodano `security`, `disk`, `why`, `process`, `session`; istniejące klucze `hw`/`health`/`perf` dostały dodatkowe pozycje
- `_followup()` dodany do 9 handlerów: `_resp_virus_check` (oba paths), `_resp_disk_health`, `_resp_disk_usage_why`, `_resp_battery_drain`, `_resp_uptime`, `_resp_process_info` (oba paths), `_resp_throttle_check` (OK path), `_resp_perf_change`, `_resp_session_compare`
- `record_response_data` dodany do: `_resp_hw_gpu` (`model`, `vram_gb`), `_resp_perf_change` (`cpu_today/yest`, `ram_today/yest`), `_resp_session_compare` (`cpu/ram today/yest`)

### hck_GPT — hardware scanner & session data

**`hck_gpt/context/hardware_scanner.py`**
- WMI scan uzupełniony o RAM speed (MHz) i part number (`Win32_PhysicalMemory`)
- Skanowanie modelu dysku głównego (`Win32_DiskDrive`, pierwszy wpis)

**`hck_gpt/memory/session_memory.py`**
- Session data store: `record_response_data(intent, data)`, `get_response_data(intent)`, `discussed_this_session()` — pozwala późniejszym handlerom referować dane raportowane wcześniej w sesji

**`hck_gpt/panel.py`**
- `_apply_nav_links(widget, text)` — renderuje `[→ Page]` tokeny jako klikalny link (kolor akcentu, podkreślenie on-hover), wywołuje zarejestrowany callback nawigacyjny
- `register_nav_callback(page_id, fn)` — API do rejestracji callbacków nawigacji z main window
- `_open_virtual_memory()` — helper otwierający Virtual Memory przez `subprocess` (SystemPropertiesAdvanced)

**`hck_gpt/intents/vocabulary.py`**
- Dodano multi-word patterns dla `hw_storage` i `hw_all` dla pewniejszego routingu powyżej progu confidence

- Hover brightening 1.25× aktywnej strefy
- Metryki odczytywane w daemon thread, aktualizacja przez `canvas.after(0, _draw)`
- Usunięto baner hck_GPT z zakładki Central

**Startup Manager** (`ui/pages/startup_manager.py`) — nowy plik
- Odczyt wpisów startowych z `HKCU`, `HKLM`, `HKLM32` Run via `winreg`
- Baza wiedzy 30 programów: impact (high/medium/low) + rekomendacja (disable/delay/keep)
- Trzy panele: *Optimize at startup* / *Safe to disable* / *All entries*
- Disable = prawdziwe usunięcie z rejestru (`winreg.DeleteValue`) + dialog potwierdzenia
- Preferencje zapisywane do `data/cache/startup_prefs.json`

**Services Manager** (`ui/pages/services_manager.py`) — nowy plik

### hck_GPT — naprawy logiki

- Naprawiono błąd językowy w `_show_help()` — używał `self._last_lang` przed detekcją; zmieniono na `ui_lang`
- Przepisano `_show_help()` — nagłówki `◈`, układ dwukolumnowy, wersje PL i EN

## [1.7.2] - 2026-04-22

### hck_GPT — AI Layer & Hybrid Engine

**Panel — Bordeaux Noir redesign** (`hck_gpt/panel.py`)
- Gradient banner redrawn every frame with 5-anchor black→crimson interpolation and sine-wave shimmer per strip
- Left accent bar pulses between `#8b0000` and `#ff2040`; ONLINE badge text pulses between `#ff5566` and `#cc2030`
- `AI` badge rendered as vector rectangle (`#5c0f1a` fill, white 7pt Consolas text) — no image file
- ONLINE badge: dark rect `#1e0508` + crimson outline, pulsing text; no moving line across banner
- Banner sweep at 100 ms; gradient redraw uses `tags="grad"` / `tag_raise("ui")` to keep UI elements on top
- Proactive monitor wired in `__init__`: `register_push` schedules alert messages on main thread via `after(0, ...)`; `register_banner` updates status text when panel is closed

**Chat handler** (`hck_gpt/chat_handler.py`)
- Language detected per message (`detect_language`) → `proactive_monitor.set_language(lang)` → `hybrid_engine.process(msg, result, lang)`
- `_LEGACY_ONLY_KEYWORDS` expanded to cover all `_ROUTES` keys (`alerts`, `insights`, `teaser`, `raport`, etc.) — prevents Ollama from intercepting InsightsEngine commands

**Response builder** (`hck_gpt/responses/builder.py`)
- Full bilingual rewrite: `_t(lang, pl, en)`, `_pick(lang, pl_pool, en_pool)`, `_followup(key, lang)` helpers
- 20+ handlers updated: CPU, GPU, RAM, health check, temperature, throttle, performance, greeting, thanks, help, small talk, processes, storage, optimization, uptime, power plan, stats, motherboard, service wizard
- Response variety via `random.choice()` pools: 4+4 greetings, 4+4 thanks, 3+3 health intros, 3+3 perf intros
- `_resp_hw_storage()`: skips `remote` drives, caps at 5 drives, uses `all=False` partitions (no network-drive freeze)
- `_resp_processes()`: capped at 128 process iterations

**Intent vocabulary** (`hck_gpt/intents/vocabulary.py`)
- All diagnostic intents enriched with multi-word phrases (`"health check"`, `"system health"`, `"pc health"` etc.) — confidence now reaches 1.00 for direct queries
- New `small_talk` intent (low-scoring tokens → Ollama preferred)
- Pattern tuning: diagnostic intents score ≥ 0.60 to route through rule engine

**Intent parser** (`hck_gpt/intents/parser.py`)
- Added `_ascii_fold()`, `_normalize_accents()`, `_ACCENT_MAP` for Polish accent normalization
- Dual scoring: scores against original text AND ASCII-folded version, takes `max()` — fixes "dzieki"→thanks, "wydajnosc"→performance, "specyfikacja"→hw_all
- `folded_patterns_cache` built once per `parse()` call (not per intent)

**Session memory** (`hck_gpt/memory/session_memory.py`)
- CPU/RAM trend buffers (`deque` maxlen=8): `push_metric()`, `get_trend()` (compares first/second half averages, delta > 5 = rising/falling), `trend_summary()`
- Auto-conversation-summary every 6 user messages: `_auto_summarize_impl()` extracts topic stack labels
- `get_context_for_llm()` → compact multi-section string: current topic + summary + last 3 exchanges + recent events + trends
- `add_message()`: strips null bytes, wraps auto-summarize in try/except
- `recent_exchange_text()`: strips `"hck_GPT:"` prefix, formats as `User:` / `hck_GPT:` pairs

**System context** (`hck_gpt/context/system_context.py`)
- Top 3 processes: capped at 128 iterations, stored as `{name, cpu, ram_mb}`
- Temperature reading: `sensors_temperatures()` → up to 6 readings
- Windows-safe disk: `os.environ.get("SystemDrive","C:") + "\\"`
- Trend push rate-limited to 30s; `math.isnan()` guard before `session_memory.push_metric()`
- `build_llm_context(lang)` → 6 sections: Live State, Today's Averages, Top Processes, Temperatures, Hardware Profile, Conversation Context

**Proactive monitor** (`hck_gpt/memory/proactive_monitor.py`)
- CPU counter resets to 0 immediately when CPU drops 10 % below threshold (was slow decrement)
- `cpu_percent(interval=1)` (reduced from 2s blocking)
- Windows disk path: `SystemDrive` env var with partition fallback
- `freq.max > 0` guard in throttle check; empty tips guard in `_maybe_idle_tip()`

**New: Hybrid Engine** (`hck_gpt/engine/hybrid_engine.py`, `hck_gpt/engine/__init__.py`)
- `OllamaClient`: `is_available()`, `list_models()`, `generate()` — stdlib `http.client` only, `try/finally conn.close()` in all three methods
- `HybridEngine` routing: `RULE_THRESHOLD=0.60` → rule engine; `_OLLAMA_PREFERRED_INTENTS={"small_talk","unknown"}` → Ollama first; low-confidence fallback chain
- Temporary unavailability: 60s cooldown after timeout, 30s after empty response (not a full blacklist)
- `_build_system_prompt(lang)`: 4-section prompt — Identity, Rules (9 hard rules: short, no markdown, no invented data), PC Context (`build_llm_context`), Language instruction
- Model preference: `llama3.2` > `mistral` > `phi3` > `gemma2` > `qwen2.5`
- `get_status()` → diagnostic dict

**New: Language detection** (`hck_gpt/intents/lang_detect.py`)
- `detect_language(text) → "pl" | "en"`; instant PL on diacritic detection; word-frequency scoring fallback; default PL

**New: User knowledge base** (`hck_gpt/memory/user_knowledge.py`)
- SQLite at `AppData/Local/PC_Workman_HCK/user_knowledge.db`, WAL mode, per-call connection with `try/finally`
- Tables: `hardware_profile`, `usage_patterns`, `user_facts`, `conversation_log`
- `hardware_is_fresh(max_age_hours=24)`, `build_knowledge_summary()`

**New: Hardware scanner** (`hck_gpt/context/hardware_scanner.py`)
- `scan_and_store(force=False)`: skips if fresh (24h); runs in background daemon thread on import
- `_scan_psutil()`: cores, freq, RAM, partitions; `_scan_wmi()`: CPU model, GPU + VRAM, mobo, RAM speed; `_scan_os()`: Windows version

### Efficiency Tab — Fixes & Per-Core Stats (`ui/components/yourpc_page.py`)
- Fixed C11 bug: `cpu_count(logical=True)=12` was used on 6-core CPU; switched to `cpu_count(logical=False)` → correct physical core count
- Fixed invisible avg text: `fg="#6366f1"` on dark bg → `fg="#a5b4fc"` (light lavender, clearly visible)
- Module-level `_CORE_SESSION` dict tracks min/max/sum/cnt per physical core across refresh ticks
- Core card now shows min / max / avg per core below the bar
- Side-by-side TOP CPU and TOP RAM consumers (separate `consumers_row` frame, both packed left)
- Process rank tracker (`_PROC_SESSION`): rank badge, name, NOW%, session AVG%, time-in-rank duration

### HCK_Labs Globe Icon (`ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py`)
- Replaced filled square with vector globe: circle (sphere outline) + meridian oval + equator line + N/S parallels, drawn with `create_oval` / `create_line` — no image file

### Stability Fixes
- `process_iter()` capped at 128 entries in both `system_context.py` and `responses/builder.py` (prevents UI hang on loaded systems)
- Network drive freeze: `disk_usage()` skips `remote` drives, uses `all=False`, capped at 5
- `None`/`NaN` guard before `session_memory.push_metric()`
- `_auto_summarize()` exceptions swallowed via `_auto_summarize_impl()` — `add_message()` never raises
- Null bytes sanitized in `add_message()`
- Connection leaks fixed: `try/finally conn.close()` in all three `OllamaClient` methods
- Ollama hijack of InsightsEngine commands fixed via expanded `_LEGACY_ONLY_KEYWORDS`

---

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-10

### Code Cleanup
- `core/monitor.py` — removed redundant inline comments, unused `import platform`, `### HCK_Labs` header
- `core/analyzer.py` — removed `### HCK_Labs` header
- `core/hardware_sensors.py` — rephrased GPU clock comment, removed "Note:" prefix
- `ui/windows/main_window_expanded.py` — deleted dead `_build_yourpc_page_OLD_REMOVED` (~130 lines), stale module-moved comment, "innovative" docstring wording

### Versioning & Packaging
- Bumped version to `1.7.1` across `setup.py`, `startup.py`, `main_window.py`, `main_window_expanded.py`, `README.md`
- `requirements.txt` — removed `tkinter` and `tk>=0.1.0` (both stdlib, not pip-installable)
- Release date updated to `2026-04-10`

### Test Coverage
- `tests/test_monitor.py` — rewritten: 7 test cases; fixed broken `monitor.read()` call → `read_snapshot()`; covers snapshot keys, value types, process parsing, CPU/RAM sort, n-limit, cache hit, background thread
- `tests/test_analyzer.py` — rewritten: 7 test cases; logger injected via `COMPONENTS` mock; covers averages, spike detection, empty buffer, old-sample filtering, threshold edge cases
- `tests/test_avg_calculator.py` — rewritten: 4 test cases; uses `tempfile` + patched `HOURLY` path; covers missing file, single-day avg, multi-day split, result key presence

### UI — TOP 5 Process Panels
- Row height `22px → 36px`; layout changed from single-line to 2-line: name on top, CPU+RAM bars below
- Labels `C` / `R` replaced with `CPU` (blue) / `RAM` (amber) with accent color matching bar fill
- Max visible process name length `14 → 20` characters
- Thin vertical divider between CPU and RAM halves

### AnimatedBar — Reusable Animated Progress Bar
- New class `AnimatedBar` in `ui/components/led_bars.py`
- Ease-out interpolation: `EASE = 0.18`, `~60fps` via `after(16ms)`, snaps at `< 0.4%` delta
- API: `bar.bg_frame` for layout placement, `bar.set_target(pct)` to animate
- Applied to: TOP 5 user process rows, TOP 5 system process rows, Session Averages (CPU/GPU/RAM)

### Dashboard Chart — Bug Fixes & Colors
- Fixed blank chart on startup: `<Configure>` binding detects when canvas has real dimensions and triggers first draw
- Added `_schedule_chart_update()` with `after_cancel()` — prevents duplicate update loops
- Filter buttons `LIVE / 1H / 4H / 1D / 1W / 1M` now trigger immediate redraw (`after(50ms)`) instead of waiting for 2s timer
- Fixed bar colors: CPU `#3b82f6`, RAM `#fbbf24`, GPU `#10b981` (replaced dark/brown placeholders)
- Placeholder text `"Collecting data..."` shown while buffer is empty instead of silent no-op

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-XX

### hck_GPT — Process Knowledge Base
- New file `hck_gpt/process_library.py` — static knowledge base with definitions for 80+ common Windows processes and applications
- Each entry includes: publisher/author, short description, security classification, energy profile, expected CPU/RAM usage ranges, and contextual notes (e.g. "Heavy load during library updates" for Epic Games Launcher, Steam)
- Categories covered: gaming launchers, browsers, development tools, communication apps, Windows system processes, media players, security software
- Used by hck_GPT tooltip system: hovering a process name in any TOP 5 panel shows a rich popup with the above data
- Graceful fallback: unknown processes display raw psutil data without crashing

---

## [1.6.8] - 2026-02-17

### hck_GPT Intelligence System
Full local intelligence layer — no external AI, all rule-based logic on Stats Engine data.

**New modules** (`hck_gpt/`):
- `insights.py` — `InsightsEngine` singleton: habit tracking, anomaly awareness, personalized teasers
- `report_window.py` — "Today Report" Toplevel window with canvas chart, colored sections, process breakdown

**InsightsEngine capabilities:**
- `get_greeting()` — time-of-day + yesterday's summary + recurring app teaser (cached 30min)
- `get_current_insight()` — real-time spike alerts, gaming/browser detection, session milestones (dedup: won't repeat same message)
- `get_habit_summary()` — top 5 apps, browser/game/dev highlights, weekly CPU trend, recurring patterns list
- `get_health_check()` — quick diagnostics: session uptime, current load, today's averages, alert count, data collection status
- `get_anomaly_report()` — 24h events grouped by severity with timestamps + summary insight
- `get_teaser()` — 7-day recurring pattern detection, 15+ template variants per category (Gaming, Browser, Dev, Media, etc.)
- `get_banner_status()` — compact one-liner with session uptime fallback
- `_detect_recurring_patterns()` — finds apps used on 50%+ of last 7 days (>5% CPU or >100MB RAM)
- Session milestone notifications at 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h marks

**ChatHandler commands:** `stats`, `habits`, `health`, `alerts`, `insights`, `teaser`, `report`, `help`
- Polish language: `co uzywam`, `statystyki`, `co nowego`, `alerty`, `co dzis`, `zdrowie`, `raport`
- Default response now shows current insight instead of "AI not connected"
- `report` command shows text summary + points to visual Today Report button

**Panel upgrades:**
- Rainbow gradient "Today Report!" button (canvas-based, full-width, hover effect)
- Smooth pixel-level fade banner (5-anchor RGB interpolation)
- Auto-greeting on panel open (once per 30min session)
- Insight ticker: 60s interval, dedup (no repeat messages), `winfo_exists()` guards
- Banner status ticker: 30s interval with session uptime fallback

**Today Report window (Toplevel):**
- Session uptime + lifetime uptime + data collection status (days tracked, data points)
- Mini canvas chart: CPU/GPU/RAM lines with Y-axis % labels, X-axis time labels (start→end)
- Averages panel + Peaks panel side-by-side with chart
- Top 5 system processes + Top 5 user apps with active time, category badges (Gaming/Browser/Dev/etc.)
- Yellow alert banner: TEMP & VOLTAGES status (green/yellow/red based on severity)
- Refresh button for live data reload
- Singleton pattern (only one window open at a time)
- Scoped mousewheel binding (only when hovering report window — no leak to main app)

### HCK Stats Engine v2 — SQLite Long-Term Storage
Replaced empty CSV aggregation files with a proper SQLite pipeline.

**New modules** (`hck_stats_engine/`):
- `constants.py` — retention config (7d minute, 90d hourly, forever daily+)
- `db_manager.py` — WAL-mode SQLite, thread-local connections, auto-schema
- `aggregator.py` — minute/hourly/daily/weekly/monthly aggregation + CSV pruning
- `process_aggregator.py` — per-process CPU/RAM accumulator (in-memory dict → hourly/daily flush to SQLite)
- `query_api.py` — range queries with automatic granularity selection
- `events.py` — spike/anomaly detection with rate-limiting, severity levels

**Data pipeline:**
- `accumulate_second()` — lightweight dict update every 1s
- `on_minute_tick()` — INSERT into `minute_stats` every 60s
- Hourly/daily boundary detection → aggregation + pruning
- `flush_on_shutdown()` — graceful save on exit

**Stability guarantees:**
- Every call wrapped in try/except — scheduler never crashes
- Writes only on scheduler thread, UI reads via separate connection
- WAL mode — concurrent read/write without locks
- Atomic transactions — crash mid-aggregation → rollback
- Graceful degradation — SQLite failure → app runs on CSV as before
- Zero new dependencies (sqlite3 in stdlib)

**Integration:** `scheduler.py` (~15 lines), `startup.py` (~10 lines), `__init__.py` (imports)

### MONITORING & ALERTS — Time-Travel Statistics Center
- Temperature area chart: 1D / 3D / 1W / 1M scale, spike detection (mean + 1.5*std), yellow glow regions, hover tooltips
- Voltage/Load multi-line chart: CPU (blue) / RAM (green) / GPU (orange), anomaly highlighting
- Stats panels per metric: Today AVG, Lifetime AVG, Max Safe, Current, Today MAX, Spikes count
- AI learning status badges (green/yellow) with "PC Workman learns your patterns" messaging
- Events log section pulling from SQLite `events` table
- Auto-refresh every 30s with `winfo_exists()` guard
- New file: `ui/pages/monitoring_alerts.py` (~520 lines)

### Overlay CPU/RAM/GPU — External Desktop Widget
- Redefined as `Toplevel` with `-topmost`, `-toolwindow`, `overrideredirect`
- Positioned top-right of desktop, draggable, hidden from taskbar
- Auto-launch on startup: `root.after(1500, _launch_overlay_monitor)`
- Removed old in-app mini-monitor from header (~100 lines deleted)

### My PC Section
- Hey-USER table: replaced with cropped ProInfoTable (MOTHERBOARD + CPU sections, same style as Full Hardware Table)
- Quick action buttons wired to sidebar navigation (Stats & Alerts → Monitoring, Health Report → My PC, etc.)
- New Stability Tests page: real diagnostics (file integrity checks, HCK Stats Engine status, error logs)
- Thicker font on action buttons + 6-button layout

### Sidebar Navigation Stability Fix
- `_update_hardware_cards` and `_update_top5_processes` now guarded by `current_view == "dashboard"` — eliminates "bad window path name" errors when on other pages
- `winfo_exists()` checks added to: `_update_hardware_card`, `_render_expanded_user_processes`, `_render_expanded_system_processes`, `_update_session_bar`, `_update_live_metrics`, `_draw_sparkline`
- Routing IDs updated: `temperature`, `voltage`, `alerts` (replaced stale `realtime`, `processes`)
- Sidebar subitem renamed: "Events Log" → "Centrum & Alerts"

### Performance Optimization — Zero-Lag Dashboard
Heavy profiling and iterative optimization to eliminate all UI stutter.

**Background-threaded monitoring:**
- `Monitor.start_background_collection()` — `psutil.process_iter()` moved off GUI thread to a daemon thread
- `read_snapshot()` now returns cached data instantly (non-blocking)
- Startup: `startup.py` launches background collection before UI init

**Dashboard update cadence:**
- Main loop: 300ms → 1000ms
- Hardware cards: every 2s (was every tick)
- System tray: every 3s (was every tick)
- TOP 5 processes: every 3s (was every tick)
- Realtime chart: 2s interval with reusable canvas items (no create/delete)

**Widget reuse pattern (TOP 5 processes):**
- Previously: destroy + recreate 10 widget trees every 300ms
- Now: create once, update labels via `.config()` and `.place(relwidth=...)`

**Nav button gradient fix:**
- Removed `<Configure>` binding (fired on every window-move pixel, 8 buttons × 200 canvas lines)
- Gradient drawn once with 4px strips (window is non-resizable)
- Removed dead `_animate_button_shimmer()` (was 30 FPS / 33ms — ~800 canvas items redrawn per frame)

**Realtime chart rewrite:**
- Replaced PhotoImage pixel-by-pixel rendering (70,000 Python iterations/frame) with canvas rectangle pool
- Items created once, only `canvas.coords()` updated per tick — near-zero overhead

### Dashboard Chart — Historical Data Integration
- All time filter buttons now work: LIVE, 1H, 4H, 1D, 1W, 1M
- 1H/4H query `minute_stats`, 1D queries `hourly_stats`, 1W/1M query `daily_stats`
- Auto-refresh historical data every ~30s while on non-LIVE mode
- Chart rebuilds item pool on filter switch (handles different data sizes)

### Stats Engine Fixes
- **Lifetime uptime persistence**: `flush_on_shutdown()` now aggregates current hour into `hourly_stats`
- **Cross-session data**: `get_summary_stats()` queries all 3 tables (daily → hourly → minute) with dedup
- **System idle process filter**: filtered at source (`process_aggregator.py`) + display (`insights.py`)
- **CPU cap at 100%**: `psutil` per-core values >100% now capped in aggregator and insights

### Info Panel Restyle
- Height reduced from 100px to 50px
- Purple accent (#a78bfa), Consolas 8pt font, thin gradient line
- Typing animation with 4 rotating messages about PC Workman

### Codebase Cleanup
- Removed unused files: `utils/` package (file_utils, net_utils, system_info), `settings/` dir, `expandable_list.py`
- Removed empty artifacts: `_nul`, `nul`, `fan_settings_ultimate.json`
- Removed dead animation code (~60 lines of `_animate_button_shimmer`)
- Removed AI-style comments (CYBERPUNK, MEGA, Apple style, SystemCare, personal reminders)
- Temperature data pipeline: scheduler reads `cpu_temp`/`gpu_temp` from snapshot → passes to aggregator → stored in `minute_stats`
- Replaced temporary chart placeholders with real data-driven charts

## [v1.0.6] — 2025-11-08  
### Major Update — Core System and UI Prototype  
**Summary:**  
Comprehensive reconstruction of the project architecture. Transitioned from simulated data to real-time monitoring using `psutil`. Implemented the first functional UI with live charts and process analytics.

### Core System (Rewritten)  
**Updated files:**  
- `core/__init__.py`  
- `core/monitor.py`  
- `core/logger.py`  
- `core/analyzer.py`  
- `core/scheduler.py`  
**Main improvements:**  
- Added real-time CPU, RAM, and GPU usage acquisition via `psutil` and `GPUtil`.  
- Implemented per-second resource sampling and buffering (up to 4 hours).  
- Introduced per-minute average aggregation (for 1H mode).  
- Added continuous CSV logging: `raw_usage.csv`, `minute_avg.csv`.  
- Integrated background scheduler loop for live data collection.  
- Rebuilt analyzer for trend and average calculations.  
- Upgraded `import_core.py` to a fully traceable registry system with unique component IDs.  

**Registry example:**  
py001_hck | `core.monitor` | 2025-11-08 18:09:39
py002_hck | `core.logger` | 2025-11-08 18:09:39
py003_hck | `core.analyzer`| 2025-11-08 18:09:39
### User Interface (UI) – First Working Version  
**File:** `ui/main_window.py`  
**Major features:**  
- First working graphical interface (Tkinter + Matplotlib).  
- Mode selector: `NOW`, `1H`, `4H` (only NOW and 1H active).  
- NOW: 30-second live display updated every second.  
- 1H: 60 data points representing 1-minute averages.  
- Added side live-meter panel showing CPU and RAM load.  
- Display of top processes divided into:  
  - User processes (applications)  
  - System processes (Windows core tasks)  
- Basic process labeling system (browser, explorer, game launcher).  
- Added placeholder for `hck_GPT` assistant section.
### Data Flow Summary  
- `core.monitor` → live data sampling
- `core.logger` → stores raw & minute-averaged data
- `core.scheduler` → triggers aggregation & recording
- `ui.main_window` → visualizes NOW / 1H data
- `import_core` → tracks component registration
### Fixes and Improvements  
- Introduced headless mode (runs without GUI).  
- Added robust startup and shutdown handling.  
- Optimized thread management and CPU load.  
- Unified color scheme and improved UI readability.  
- Extended setup configuration and testing scripts. 
### Known Issues  
- Process classification not fully accurate (e.g., browsers sometimes misidentified).  
- Time axis on charts still uses timestamps instead of readable time labels.  
- 1H data requires at least 60 seconds before appearing.  
- Process description tooltips pending (only click-based details).
